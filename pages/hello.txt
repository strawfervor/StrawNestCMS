=title: Hello!

Hi there,

Welcome to your newly "installed" StrawNestCMS!

This is your very first blog post. To customize your page, start by exploring the `config.php` file. Want to add new posts? Simply place text files into the `pages` directory. For images, add them to the `images` folder and include them in your posts using the `=image:` syntax.

For links, it's best to use standard HTML tags, as they are fully supported.

A blank line between text sections creates a new paragraph.

That's all you need to create an awesome blog :D:D:D:D

Enjoy using StrawNestCMS!
