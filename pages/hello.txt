=title: Hello!

Hi there,

Welcome to your newly "installed" StrawNestCMS!

This is your very first blog post. To customize your page, start by exploring the `config.php` file. 

Want to add new posts? Simply place text files into the `pages` directory.

For images, add them to the `images` folder and include them in your posts using the `=image:` or `=imageSmall` syntax in new line.

`=image:strawnest.jpg`:

=image:strawnest.jpg

`=imageSmall:cake.jpg`:

=imageSmall:cake.jpg

For <a href="#">links</a>, it's best to use standard HTML tags, as they are fully supported.

A blank line between text sections creates a new paragraph.

That's all you need to create an awesome blog :D:D:D:D

Enjoy using StrawNestCMS!
